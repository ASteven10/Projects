This is an arcade game similar to GALAGA with a touch of my own creativity.
You will need pygame to run and play this game as it has been coded in python.
scroll to the bottom for user control instructions

***
The object of the game is simple: Defeat the Alien ships and destroy the Boss at each level.
There are 3 levels, with each boss being stronger as the levels progress.

Your ship has a green health bar. This bar shall decrease in size as you take damage from enemy fire.
The game ends when your health reaches zero.

Each boss has a red health bar. The boss is defeated and you progress to the next level when this bar reaches Zero.
The boss spawns alien minions to fight alongside it after certain intervals.

your ship's lazer beams cancel out enemy beams. be creative in using your shots for offence and defence.

you have 4 ships to transform into. each ship has a different speed and fires a different kind of beam.
be creative with transforming into a different ship according to different situations.

the game uses a scoring system to keep track of how many ships you destroyed and damage dealt to bosses.

***
